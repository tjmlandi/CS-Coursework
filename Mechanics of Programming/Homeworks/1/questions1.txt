Lab 1: System Intro, Part 1
Name: Thomas Landi

1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

   /home/

2. What command do you use to display the contents of your current
working directory, such that it shows the difference between
files and directories?

    ls -l

3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory Courses/?

    cd Courses

4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/ for this course?

    mkdir csci243

5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -c warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems.
    
    a.) What compiler flag is used to enable the display of warnings?
    
        -Wall
    
    b.) Explain, in your own words, all the warnings in warning.c.
    
        "unused variable 'b'" - a variable 'b' is declared and definied, but never used in any other part of the cdoe
	
	"'main' takes only zero or two arguments" - the main function needs either no parameters or two for the count of arguments and array of argument pointers, warning.c only has the count

	"unused variable 'x'" - same issue as unused variable b

	"control reaches end of non-void function" - the function 'compute' has an int-return type, but there is no return statement in the function
    
    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly.

6. What compiler flag is used to compile C programs using the ISO C99 
standard?

    -std=c99
   
7. Put the four steps of compilation process into their proper order from
first to last.

    A. Preprocess
    B. Compile
    C. Assemble
    D. Link
