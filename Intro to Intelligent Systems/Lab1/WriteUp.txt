The terrain part of the implementation of the cost function was mostly based on 
estimates of how fast I would normally traverse the terrain conditions,
based on previous experience. The cost function would then multiply the distance
to the next point to adjust for this difference in speed to a normal travel speed
through an open field. For the elevation, a curve was picked that would fit the grade
to a multiplier, where the more negative the grade, the shorter the distance would
get, and vice versa, with a negative 50% equating to twice the movement speed,
0% equating to the same movement speed (flat ground) and positive 100% to half the 
movement speed (45 degree incline). Lastly, the distance from the point to the goal
was also factored into the cost, to weight the path towards points in the direction
of the overall goal, as that would generally be the trend for shorter paths. 
Most of the justification for the multipliers came from previous personal hiking experience,
so it may not be experimentally correct, but I was unsure of where to find data for 
walking speeds as a function of terrain/elevation changes.

The human readable output was done as a trail drawn over the original map, as that 
seemed the clearest to interperet.
